# Spark Examples
This repository contains several examples of using Datasets and DataFrames in [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).  There are a few additional examples showing interactions with other systems (e.g., [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)).

It's assumed that you are running these on a local machine.
